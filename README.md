🚀 Power BI Dashboard Project: COVID-19 Report Analytics 🌍📊
🔍 Just completed an interactive COVID-19 Dashboard using Power BI based on real-world country-wise data from March to April 2020.

Key Highlights:
✅ KPI Cards: Total Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths, Active Cases
📈 Time-Series Trend: Daily new cases, deaths & recovery over time
🌍 Geo Map: Population infected % across the globe
📊 Pie & Bar Charts: Country-wise case & death share
🎯 Filters: Country & Date slicers for drill-down analysis
🔥 Calculated Measures:
• Active Cases = Confirmed - (Recovered + Deaths)
• Recovery & Fatality Rates
• % Day-wise change in Confirmed Cases

💻 Tools Used:
Power BI, DAX (Calculated Columns/Measures), Data Cleaning

🧠 Learning Outcome:
Got hands-on experience in real-time data modeling, DAX logic building, and story-telling through visuals. Built with a focus on clarity, interactivity, and insights.
